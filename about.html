                        HTML and CSS (because we're considering that too) are <strong>undeniably languages used by
                            programmers</strong>,
                        although in this context, perhaps better terms would be designers, developers or engineers, but
                        whether they
                        constitute <strong>programming languages</strong> has divided the community into two camps, each
                        stubbornly
                        defending their position. Mostly I find this debate to be fuelled by trolls who seek to
                        infuriate their peers, or
                        gatekeepers who seek to distinguish between those who are programmers and those who are merely
                        designers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        Given the depth and breadth of this topic, I cannot possibly draw to conclusion whether HTML and
                        CSS are, or are not
                        programming languages, however I would like to draw attention to the evidence, and though
                        comprehensive research
                        and analysis, provide a fair and educational review.
                    </p>

                        In order to be impartial, <strong>this website uses zero lines of JavaScript or
                            WebAssembly!</strong> It's also
                        responsive, which in itself demonstrates some level of conditional logic. Even the navigation
                        menu (on mobile
                        devices) is implemented using only HTML and CSS, which is admittedly a bit hacky, goes against
                        web accessibility
                        guidelines and ruins the semantics. Whilst you could argue that this behaviour is attributed to
                        CSS more than it's
                        attributed to HTML, it does prove that conditional and stateful behaviour can be modelled, at
                        least in a limited
                        sense, without resorting to JavaScript or WebAssembly.

                        I highly recommend that you read the

                        <strong><a href="arguments.html">Arguments</a></strong>, and

                        I believe that HTML sits on the cusp of the debate, where the definitions that constitute
                        <strong>programming</strong> are so broad and varied that it's really difficult to say that it
                        <strong>definitely
                            is</strong>, or it <strong>definitely isn&#39;t</strong> a programming language, but if I
                        were to give any sort
                        of conclusion based on the evidence, I'd say that <strong>it isn&#39;t</strong>, more than it
                        is, but I also
                        wouldn't disqualify HTML entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        HTML is not general-purpose, and it's not Turing-complete, therefore it's not capable of
                        performing arbitrary
                        computation. HTML has no mechanism for declaring variables (and no, the <code>&lt;var&gt;</code>
                        element doesn't
                        count), although arguably you can declare constants, since all HTML elements are constant
                        without the use of DOM
                        manipulation. HTML has limited capacity to read input using buttons, text boxes, select boxes,
                        check boxes, radio
                        buttons, and even files via the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>,
                        <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
                        and <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> elements, however these are mostly useless without JavaScript,
                        WebAssembly, CSS,
                        or a back-end system, and ultimately require user intervention. HTML has limited capacity to
                        write output using a
                        video display unit (since many elements are visual, notably the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>
                        element, capable of
                        arbitrary drawing) or audio output device (since modern HTML has <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and
                        <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements), but no capacity to write output to storage devices (unless
                        you consider
                        printing your web pages and storing them on paper, and no, don't take that seriously, because it
                        doesn't even
                        remotely qualify). HTML has no mechanism for performing logical, arithmetic or conditional
                        operations. HTML can
                        define lists via the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> elements, but has no
                        capacity to iterate
                        over them. Finally, HTML has no mechanism for defining sub-routines, modules, functions, or
                        procedures. Whilst you
                        could argue that the <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> element might be equivalent to creating a
                        declarative sub-routine
                        or module, it's useless without JavaScript or WebAssembly.

                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        Whilst HTML is neither general-purpose or Turing-complete, it does constitute a
                        <strong>limited</strong>,
                        <strong>declarative</strong> and <strong>domain-specific</strong> language (DSL) that allows you
                        to declaratively
                        describe the logical order and semantics of an active document. As a
                        <strong>declarative</strong> language, as
                        opposed to an <strong>imperative</strong> language, it allows a developer to describe
                        <strong>what</strong> should
                        go on a web page, rather than describing <strong>how</strong> to put it there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        HTML is an interpreted language and does not <strong>directly</strong> execute on the underlying
                        machine. Instead,
                        HTML provides a mechanism to declare <strong>objects</strong> which are interpreted by a web
                        browser, parsed into a
                        Document Object Model (DOM) tree which are then executed by the browser, which renders those
                        objects to a display,
                        and optionally an audio output device where the document may contain <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>
                        or
                        <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        Therefore, HTML <strong>does</strong> affect the <strong>execution state</strong> of the
                        underlying machine, but
                        only in an <strong>incredibly limited</strong> sense. Whilst you cannot do much else with pure
                        HTML, when combined
                        with CSS (which by many is also <strong>not</strong> considered a programming language), you can
                        begin to build some
                        simple and even interactive programs and algorithms, for which I have provided <a

                        I am the founder of ONIXLabs and a Principal Software Engineer at R3, working on Distributed

                        programming languages are
                        C#, Kotlin and TypeScript.
