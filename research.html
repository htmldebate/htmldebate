                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        A <strong>programming language</strong> is a system of notation for writing computer programs.
                        Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They
                        are a kind of <strong>computer language</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        The term <strong>computer language</strong> is sometimes used interchangeably with programming
                        language. However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of
                        each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages. Similarly,
                        languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are
                        generically designated computer languages. For instance, <strong>markup languages are sometimes
                            referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for
                            programming</strong>. One way of classifying computer languages is by the computations they
                        are capable of expressing, as described by the theory of computation. The majority of practical
                        programming languages are Turing complete, and all Turing complete languages can implement the
                        same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples of languages that are not
                        Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages. However, <strong>some authors
                            restrict the term programming language to Turing complete languages</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        Another usage regards <strong>programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming
                            abstract machines</strong> and <strong>computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on
                            physical computers</strong>, which have finite hardware resources. John C. Reynolds
                        emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the
                        languages intended for execution. He also argues that <strong>textual and even graphical input
                            formats that affect the behaviour of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact
                            they are commonly not Turing-complete</strong>, and remarks that ignorance of programming
                        language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        A programming language does not need to be <strong>imperative</strong> or
                        <strong>Turing-complete</strong>, but must be <strong>executable</strong> and so <strong>does
                            not include markups such as HTML or XML</strong>, but does include domain-specific languages
                        such as SQL and its dialects.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mt-4">Turing Machines</h2>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation describing an abstract machine that
                        manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's
                        simplicity, it is capable of implementing any computer algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing, who called it an
                        <strong>a-machine</strong> (automatic machine). It was Turing's Doctoral advisor, Alonzo Church
                        who later coined the term <strong>Turing machine</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mt-4">Turing Completeness</h2>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction
                        set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be
                        <strong>Turing-complete</strong> or <strong>computationally universal</strong> if it can be used
                        to simulate any Turing machine (devised by English mathematician and computer scientist Alan
                        Turing). This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule
                        sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule
                        set. <strong>Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        In colloquial usage, the terms <strong>Turing-complete</strong> and
                        <strong>Turing-equivalent</strong> are used to mean that any real-world general-purpose computer
                        or computer language can approximately simulate the computational aspects of any other
                        real-world general-purpose computer or computer language. In real life, this leads to the
                        practical concepts of computing virtualization and emulation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        Real computers constructed so far can be functionally analyzed like a single-tape Turing machine
                        (the "tape" corresponding to their memory); thus the associated mathematics can apply by
                        abstracting their operation far enough. However, real computers have limited physical resources,
                        so they are only linear bounded automaton complete. In contrast, a universal computer is defined
                        as a device with a Turing-complete instruction set, infinite memory, and infinite available
                        time.

                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows
                        programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a
                        document.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and
                        each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you
                        can change the document's structure, style, or content.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mt-4">
                        The HTML DOM is an object model for HTML. It defines HTML elements as objects, which can have
                        properties, methods and events, however these are only accessible via
                        <strong>JavaScript</strong> through the HTML DOM API.
