                            sense that a programming language does. HTML contains no programming logic. It doesn't have

                            statements such as If/Else. It can't evaluate expressions or do any math. It doesn't handle

                            tasks. You can't declare variables and you can't write functions. It doesn't modify or
                            manipulate data in any
                            way. HTML can't take input and produce output. Think of it this way: you can't compute the

                            that's not what it's for. This is because HTML is not a programming language.

                        Alvaro's article makes some excellent points, many of which are reiterated on the arguments
                        page. His goal is not to
                        prove whether HTML is or is not a programming language, but rather to dispel the main arguments,
                        which are commonly
                        flawed or incorrect, thus invalidating the conclusion from a logical point of view.

                            While some markup languages might be considered programming languages, I'm not saying that
                            HTML is one of them.
                            The point is that the original statement is wrong: markup languages can be programming
                            languages. Therefore,
                            saying that HTML is not a programming language because it is a markup language is based on a
                            false statement,
                            and whatever conclusion you arrive at from that premise will be categorically wrong.

                            The definition of what programming is (or is not) changes with time. I bet someone sorting
                            through punched cards
                            complained about how typing code in assembly was not real programming. There's nothing
                            universal or written in
                            stone. There's no actual definition.

                            Turing-completeness is a fair standard, I must say, but one that is biased and subjective —
                            not in its form but
                            in the way it is picked. Why is it that a language capable of generating a Turing Complete
                            Machine gets riveted
                            as a “programming language” while another capable of generating a Finite State Machine is
                            not? It is subjective.
                            It is an excuse like any other to differentiate between “real developers” (the ones making
                            the claim) and those
                            inferior to them.

                        Darcy DeClute's article makes many of the same arguments as the articles above. HTML isn't
                        Turing complete, and it
                        can't perform any sort of arbitrary computation. Rather it just "marks up" content. This article
                        also investigates
                        the combination of CSS and HTML and whether they meet the threshold to qualify as a programming
                        language, ultimately
                        suggesting that they don't. According to Darcy "it's easy to write your first HTML program"
                        which is a little
                        tongue-in-cheek.

                            from being Turing
                            complete. It's a markup language for structuring documents."

                            One question that often arises is if CSS is a programming language, or if the combination of

                            the threshold to qualify as a programming language. Unfortunately, they don't.
